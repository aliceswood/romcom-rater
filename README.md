I started off creating a very basic plan of what the app would look like to get clearer in my mind what functionality I would need to implement. This also helped me to identify what external resources or learning I might need to look into such as a film API, or additional framework understanding.

The next step I took was to decide on using Next.js as the project framework. I had heard that a lot of companies use Next.js as it enables server-side rendering which would improve UX and performance due to the reduced processing time of the site. I was keen to learn  more about Next.js and the other benefits that come with doing so.

I started off following the Next.js tutorial which I adapted slightly from a blog to a film storage. Upon finishing the tutorial, I identified that it was reliant on reading files from my computer in order to display information. This was not ideal as I would be using an external API to import film information, so while those files served their purpose as a learning tool, the files needed some streamlining.

Another point that I noted from the tutorial is that testing was not discussed. Now that I had the bare bones and a couple of pages, I decided it would be a good time to get some very basic tests as part of the project to ensure pages were rendering.
